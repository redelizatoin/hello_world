# hello_world



Hi everyone!
I just wanted to officially test my hand at GitHub and learn how to make/commit changes. 
Pretty soon I will be making all kinds of changes to repositories here and I would appreciate all the advice you all can give.
My computer science journey has just begun!

Cheers,
Rick.
